### Hi! I'm Diana! 👋

I am a Health Tech Engineer 👩‍💻 and former Molecular Biologist 👩‍🔬.  Currently, I am pursuing my M.S., Applied Info Science & Info Systems in Health Technology at Cornell Tech. I sit at the intersection of life sciences and AI strategy, building computational tools and strategic frameworks that translate complex data into actionable clinical insights.

#### 🔭 What I'm currently working on
*  **JupyterHealth:** Leading the design and technical development of a clinician-facing tool to bridge EHRS (FHIR) with continuous wearable data (Oura/Whoop).  I am integrating MCP servers for LLM assisted workflows in precision medicine.
*  **Trust & Safety AI:** Produced a comprehensive user-centric safety policy and developed a moderation labeler for "grey area" survivor content on the BlueSky platform, balancing expression with safety.

#### 🌱 What I'm exploring
*  **AI Strategy & Landscape Analysis:** Conducting comparative analysis of medical and biopharma AI tooling in a joint study with MIT CSAIL to identify the utility gap between current research capabilities and practitioner workflows and needs.
*  **Predictive Healthcare Models:** Trained and compared ML models on wearable datasets to predict patient stress scores, sleep quality, and monitor disease progression.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
*  **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, React/Javascript, SQL, R, AWS, MCP.
*  **Health Data & Design:** Figma, User-Centric Design, Wearable Sensor Data, EHR Integration.
