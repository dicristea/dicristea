### Hello! I'm Diana, a software engineer 👩‍💻 and scientist 👩‍🔬! 
I’ve been exploring the biological mechanisms of cancer for the last few years and have been completely invested in creating meaningful and intuitive software! I’m very excited to be working in the space of Human Computer Interaction, AI in Healthcare, and Information Science at Cornell Tech. I'm currently working on several projects including an application for Weill Cornell Medicine in JupyterHealth.
