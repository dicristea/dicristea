### Hello! I'm Diana, a software engineer 👩‍💻 and scientist 👩‍🔬! 
I’ve been exploring the biological mechanisms of cancer for the last few years and have lately been completely overtaken by my interest in creating meaningful and intuitive software projects. 
I’m very excited to have embarked on my journey as a software engineer and bring my diverse knowledge to the field!
