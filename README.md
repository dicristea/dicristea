### Hi! I'm Diana! 👋

[cite_start]I am a Health Tech Engineer 👩‍💻 and former Molecular Biologist 👩‍🔬[cite: 9, 19]. [cite_start]Currently, I am pursuing my M.S., Applied Info Science & Info Systems - Health Technology at Cornell Tech Graduate School[cite: 8, 9]. I sit at the intersection of life sciences, AI strategy, and digital health consulting, building computational tools and strategic frameworks that translate complex data into actionable clinical insights.

#### 🔭 What I'm currently working on
* [cite_start]**JupyterHealth:** Leading the design and technical development of a clinician-facing tool to bridge EHRS (FHIR) with continuous wearable data (Oura/Whoop)[cite: 12]. [cite_start]I am integrating MCP servers for LLM assisted workflows in precision medicine[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Trust & Safety AI:** Produced a comprehensive user-centric safety policy and developed a moderation labeler for "grey area" survivor content on the BlueSky platform, balancing expression with safety[cite: 17].

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* [cite_start]**Languages & Frameworks:** Python, React, SQL, R, AWS, MCP[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Health Data & Design:** Figma, User-Centric Design, Wearable Sensor Data, EHR Integration[cite: 5, 12, 35].

#### 🌱 What I'm exploring
* [cite_start]**AI Strategy & Landscape Analysis:** Conducting comparative analysis of medical and biopharma AI tooling in a joint study with MIT CSAIL to identify the utility gap between current research capabilities and practitioner workflows and needs[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**Predictive Healthcare Models:** Trained and compared ML models on "All of Us" wearable dataset to predict patient stress scores[cite: 15].

#### ⚡ Fun facts
When I'm not analyzing clinical data or developing AI strategy, you can usually find me rolling dice in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, trying out a new spicy Szechuan recipe, or catching an electronic music set!
I’ve been exploring the biological mechanisms of cancer for the last few years and have been completely invested in creating meaningful and intuitive software! I’m very excited to be working in the space of Human Computer Interaction, AI in Healthcare, and Information Science at Cornell Tech. I'm currently working on several projects including an application for Weill Cornell Medicine in JupyterHealth.
